## Purpose
The repository implements image resize functionality deployment with xOpera for Azure Platform.

## Functionality
The main functionality of image-resize is to create thumbnails from the source image. Source image must be uploaded into
source bucket and then three thumbnails will be created and saved to another bucket.

## Quick test and deploy

If you want to test this solution immediately run the following commands:

> :pencil: I you face any problems consider reading the whole manual!

```shell script
# install Azure CLI and try to login in your account
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
az login

# install prerequisites
cd azure
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ansible
pip install opera

# setup azure function tools
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install azure-functions-core-tools
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# run xOpera service (make sure to setup the env vars in yml file)
opera deploy -i inputs.yml resize_service_opera_v1_3.yml
```

## Deployment instructions
The next part explains the deployment of this solution in detail.

### Prerequisites
This topic explains prerequisites to run xOpera deploy via Azure. If you want to test it immediately go to [quick test](#quick-test)

To be able to run these roles you should use virtual environment, install the latest Ansible version.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ansible
```

Next, you can install opera orchestrator to your virtual environment from [here](https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera).
Basically you need to install it using `pip install opera`.

You should also install and sign in with [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
using `az login` command. This is important because user gets authenticated via cli right now.

The next thing is to set up the Azure function tools using the commands below:

```bash
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install azure-functions-core-tools
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

### Roles and deployment
There are 3 playbooks separated into folders. Usage is explained in the table below:

| Role | Purpose
|:-------------|:-------------|
| **container-create** | Creates storage account and necessary container on specified Azure storage account |
| **function-deploy** | Creates FunctionApp and deploys a new function to Azure portal using Azure CLI |
| **container-notification** | Creates an event subscription trigger for function |

#### Container deploy
This part is used to create two containers (buckets) - original and resized on Azure Storage Account. Original container is used
to upload images and then resized images get stored into resized container. This part also includes creating a whole new storage account.

#### Function deploy
Azure functions first need Azure Function App. Here we create a new Function App and then we deploy our Azure function
by calling `funct functionapp publish` which deploys all functions stored in functionApp folder (these are visible in 
`playbooks/function-deploy/functions`). Currently there is a function called `image-resize-function` which is used for
creating thumbnails. 

#### Container notification
This part sets container notification for incoming container so that when a new image is uploaded that would trigger
specified function from the functionApp. So here we use Azure EventGrid by creating event subscription.

### Setting inputs
You can modify values of variables stored in `inputs.yml` to set the suitable parameters like IPs, auth params, container names, paths etc. 
Currently the following values can be modified:

| Inout (variable) | Purpose | Example
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| `host_ip` | IP address of your target machine for execution | localhost |
| `location` | Location for the created resources | westeurope |
| `resource_group_name` | Name of the resource group | Resource-Group |
| `storage_account_name` | The name of the new storage account | mystorageaccount |
| `container_in_name` | The name of the incoming Azure blob storage container | original |
| `container_out_name` | The name of the container with results | resized |
| `function_app_name` | Name of the new Function App | MyFunctionApp |
| `function_name` | Name of the new Azure function - should be the same as folder name of the function | image-resize-function |
| `event_subscription_name` | Name of event subscription trigger that will be created | thumbnail-function-trigger |

The file with inputs is later passed to xOpera at the beginning of the orchestration.

## Running with xOpera
You can run xOpera resize service with `opera deploy -i inputs.yml resize_service_opera_v1_3.yml`
